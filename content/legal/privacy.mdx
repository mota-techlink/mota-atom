This Privacy Policy describes how MOTA ATOM ("the Site," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you use our website, motaiot.com.

We primarily collect information you provide directly to us when you use our services, specifically through our OAuth (Sign-in) integration.

**Information Collected via Google/Third-Party Login (OAuth):**

When you choose to sign in using Google or other third-party providers, we collect only the minimum required information to identify your account and provide service continuity, which includes:

* **Identifier:** The unique user ID provided by the third-party service (e.g., Google `sub` ID).
* **Name:** Your display name, as provided by the third-party profile.
* **Email Address:** Your primary email address, used for login and identification purposes.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

* **Service Authentication:** To verify your identity and allow you to log in to our services.
* **Session Management:** To keep you logged in and maintain your session across different pages.
* **Conversation History:** To link your unique user ID with your past AI chat conversations (data stored locally in our database).
* **Account Maintenance:** To manage your account and prevent fraudulent activity.

We do not use your email address for marketing purposes unless you explicitly opt-in.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

* **Data Location:** Your authentication records, user ID, and chat history are stored on our database (Cloudflare D1), which is located on Cloudflare’s global network infrastructure.
* **Security:** We implement security measures, including HTTPS encryption and secure JWT session management, to protect your data. All third-party login credentials (passwords, tokens) are handled exclusively by the third-party provider (e.g., Google) and are **never** stored on our servers.
