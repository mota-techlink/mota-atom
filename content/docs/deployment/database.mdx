<Step title = "Setup">

> We need to tell local code who is the big bro.

* Copy Reference ID from  Supabase Dashboard -> Settings -> General  (Sort like vjqwxqz... string)。

```bash
# Init (if first time)
npx supabase init

# connect remote project (Reference ID)
npx supabase link --project-ref ReferenceID
# This step will ask for password of database
```
</Step>

<Step title = "Generate transfer doc (Auto diff)">

```bash
# pull from remote as base line (First time)
npx supabase db pull

# Create new update (E.g. just added documents table)
# it will generate new .sql in to supabase/migrations folder
npx supabase db diff --use-migra -f update_schema
```
</Step>
<Step title = "Automatic">

Add follwoing content into package.json.
```json
"scripts": {
  // ... Others
  "db:pull": "supabase db pull",
  "db:push": "supabase db push" 
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Regular Ops

2. run cmd:
```bash
npm run db:push
